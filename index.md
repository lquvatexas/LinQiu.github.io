**The existence of us lies purely on conditional probability.**

Welcome to my personal homepage! Please reach out to me at lq666988@gmail.com if you have any questions about my research or just want to say "Hi". 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu), where I received rigorous training in both statistics and machine learning. I was mentored by [Dr. Vernon M. Chinchilli](https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/vernon-chinchilli) and [Dr. Lynn Lin](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/lin.l).

I hold an M.S. in Statistics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), advised by 
[Dr. Michael Daniels](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~daniels/).

Before that, I studied cell and molecular biology at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University). I am from Sichuan, China.

I work broadly in the areas of **Probabilistic Deep Learning**, **Causal Inference**, **Computer Vision**. Specifically, my research interests fall into: 1. Generative models in multimodal learning, with applications on multi-omics data, medical pathology images, and human motion capture data. 2. Probabilistic deep multiple hypothesis testing, with applications on social media user engagement understanding. 3. Casual inference in graphical neural network. 

Currently, I am working with [Genentech Research & Early Development (gRED)](https://www.gene.com)  as an AI Scientist.
