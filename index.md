**The existence of us lies purely on conditional probability.**

Welcome to my personal homepage! Please reach out to me at lq666988@gmail.com if you have any questions about my research or just want to say "Hi". 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu), where I received rigorous training in both statistics and biostatistics. I was mentored by [Prof. Vernon M. Chinchilli](https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/vernon-chinchilli) and [Prof. Lin Lin](http://www.personal.psu.edu/lul37/index.html).

I hold an M.S. in Statistics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), advised by 
[Prof. Michael Daniels](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~daniels/).

Before that, I studied cell and molecular biology at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University). I am from Sichuan, China.

I work broadly in the areas of **Bayesian statistics**, **machine learning**, **time series**, and **high dimensional statistics**. Specifically, my research interests fall into: 1. Generative Models in Multimodal Learning, with applications on multi-omics data, medical pathology images, and human motion capture data. 2. Probabilistic Deep Multiple Hypothesis Testing, with applications on social media user engagement understanding, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and biomarker discovery. 3. Subgroup Identification and Personalized Precision Medicine. 4. Time series machine learning and clinical image analysis for disease progression prediction.

Currently, I am workinig for the world leading biotech company [Genentech](https://www.gene.com) (业界黄埔军校) as an AI scientist.
