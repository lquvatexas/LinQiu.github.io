**The existence of us lies purely on conditional probability.**

Welcome to my personal homepage! Please reach out to me at lq666988@gmail.com if you have any questions about my research or just want to say "Hi". 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu), where I received rigorous training in both statistics and machine learning. I was mentored by [Dr. Vernon M. Chinchilli](https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/vernon-chinchilli) and [Dr. Lynn Lin](http://www.personal.psu.edu/lul37/index.html).

I hold an M.S. in Statistics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), advised by 
[Dr. Michael Daniels](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~daniels/).

Before that, I studied cell and molecular biology at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University). I am from Sichuan, China.

I work broadly in the areas of **Probabilistic Deep Learning**, **Causal Inference**, **Computer Vision**. Specifically, my research interests fall into: 1. Generative models in multimodal learning, with applications on multi-omics data, medical pathology images, and human motion capture data. 2. Probabilistic deep multiple hypothesis testing, with applications on social media user engagement understanding, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and biomarker discovery. 3. Casual inference in graphical neural network. 

Currently, I am working with [Genentech Research & Early Development (gRED)](https://www.gene.com)  as an AI research scientist.
