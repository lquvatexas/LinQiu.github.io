Welcome to my personal homepage! Email me at: lq666988@gmail.com if you have any question about my research or just want to say "Hi". 

I obtained my PhD degree from Penn State University, where I got rigorous training in both statistics and biostatistics. I was mentored by Prof. Vernon M. Chinchilli and Prof. Lin Lin. 

I work broadly in the areas of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, time series and high dimensional statistics. Specifically, my research interests fall into: 1. Generative Models in Multi-view Learning, with applicatons in multi-omics data, medical pathology images, and human motion capture data. 2. Probabilistic Deep Multiple Hypothesis Testing, with applications in social media data user engagement understanding, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and biomarker discovery; 3. Subgroup Identification and Personalized Precision Medicine; 4.Time Series Machine Learning and Natural Lanuage Processing (NLP).

I joined the world leading biotech company [Genentech](https://www.gene.com) as a statistical scientist in Feb 2021.
