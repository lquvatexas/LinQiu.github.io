I worked with [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com) (Santa Monica, CA) as a research scientist intern on user engagement understanding, and [AbbVie SDS](https://www.abbvie.com) (Cambridge, MA) as a statistical research intern on patient subgroup identification for clinical trials during fall 2020 and summer 2019.  

I'm a marathon runner and music lover. 

It is believed that the gods created the world full of magic and inexhaustible energy. To human beings, powers from
three energy sources are the strongest - solar energy, love and imagination. Therefore I would like to choose
a career I will love, and let my imagination release imprisoned possibilities.
