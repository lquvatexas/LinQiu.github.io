I worked with the innovation engine, [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com), of [Snap Inc.](https://www.snap.com/en-US/) as a research scientist intern on user engagement understanding, and [AbbVie SDS](https://www.abbvie.com) as a machine learning intern on patient subgroup identification for clinical trials during fall 2020 and summer 2019.  

I'm a marathon runner and music lover. 

It is believed that the gods created the world full of magic and inexhaustible energy. To human beings, powers from
three energy sources are the strongest - solar energy, love and imagination. Therefore I would like to chase
a career I will love, and let my imagination release imprisoned possibilities.
