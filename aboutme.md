I worked with [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com) (Santa Monica, CA) as a research scientist intern working on user engagement understanding, and [AbbVie SDS](https://www.abbvie.com) (Cambridge, MA) as a statistical research intern on patient subgroup identification for clinical trials during fall 2020 and summer 2019.  

I hold an M.S. in Statistics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), advised by 
[Dr.Michael Daniels](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~daniels/). **M.S. report topic**: Methods of Genotype Imputation for Genome-wide Association Studies.

Before that, I studied cell and molecular biology under applied biology department at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University). I am from Sichuan, China.

I'm a marathon runner and music lover. 

It is believed that the gods created the world full of magic and inexhaustible energy. To human beings, powers from
three energy sources are the strongest - solar energy, love and imagination. Therefore I would like to choose
a career I will love, and let my imagination release imprisoned possibilities.
